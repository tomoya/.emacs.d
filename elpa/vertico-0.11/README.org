* Introduction

Vertico provides a minimalistic vertical completion UI, which is based on the
default completion system. By reusing the default system, Vertico achieves full
compatibility with built-in Emacs commands and completion tables. Vertico is
pretty bare-bone and comes with only a minimal set of commands. The code base is
small (~500 lines of code without whitespace and comments). Additional
enhancements can be installed separately via complementary packages.

* Features

- Vertical display with arrow key navigation
- Prompt shows the current candidate index and the total number of candidates
- The current candidate is inserted with =TAB= and selected with =RET=
- Non-existing candidates can be entered by moving the point to the prompt line
- Sorting by history position, string length and alphabetically
- Long candidates with newlines are formatted to take up less space
- Deferred completion style highlighting for performance
- Support for ~annotation-function~, ~affixation-function~ and ~group-function~

* Configuration

Vertico is available from [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/vertico.html][GNU ELPA]], such that it can be installed directly via
~package-install~. After installation, the global minor mode can be enabled with
=M-x vertico-mode=. In order to configure Vertico and other packages in your
init.el, you may want to use ~use-package~. I recommend to give orderless
completion a try, which is different from the familiar prefix TAB completion.
Here is an example configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Enable vertico
  (use-package vertico
    :init
    (vertico-mode)

    ;; Optionally enable cycling for `vertico-next' and `vertico-previous'.
    ;; (setq vertico-cycle t)
  )

  ;; Use the `orderless' completion style.
  ;; Enable `partial-completion' for files to allow path expansion.
  ;; You may prefer to use `initials' instead of `partial-completion'.
  (use-package orderless
    :init
    (setq completion-styles '(orderless)
          completion-category-defaults nil
          completion-category-overrides '((file (styles . (partial-completion))))))

  ;; Persist history over Emacs restarts. Vertico sorts by history position.
  (use-package savehist
    :init
    (savehist-mode))

  ;; A few more useful configurations...
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    ;; Add prompt indicator to `completing-read-multiple'.
    (defun crm-indicator (args)
      (cons (concat "[CRM] " (car args)) (cdr args)))
    (advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :filter-args #'crm-indicator)

    ;; Grow and shrink minibuffer
    ;;(setq resize-mini-windows t)

    ;; Do not allow the cursor in the minibuffer prompt
    (setq minibuffer-prompt-properties
          '(read-only t cursor-intangible t face minibuffer-prompt))
    (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'cursor-intangible-mode)

    ;; Enable recursive minibuffers
    (setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t))
#+end_src

* Key bindings

Vertico defines its own local keymap in the minibuffer which is derived from
~minibuffer-local-map~. The keymap mostly keeps the ~fundamental-mode~
keybindings intact and remaps and binds only a few commands. Note in particular
the binding of =TAB= to ~vertico-insert~ and the bindings of
~vertico-exit/exit-input~.

- ~beginning-of-buffer~, ~minibuffer-beginning-of-buffer~ -> ~vertico-first~
- ~end-of-buffer~ -> ~vertico-last~
- ~scroll-down-command~ -> ~vertico-scroll-down~
- ~scroll-up-command~ -> ~vertico-scroll-up~
- ~next-line~, ~next-line-or-history-element~ -> ~vertico-next~
- ~previous-line~, ~previous-line-or-history-element~ -> ~vertico-previous~
- ~exit-minibuffer~ -> ~vertico-exit~
- ~kill-ring-save~ -> ~vertico-save~
- =<C-return>= -> ~vertico-exit-input~
- =TAB= -> ~vertico-insert~

* TAB completion

The bindings of the ~minibuffer-local-completion-map~ are not available in
Vertico by default. This means that TAB works differently from what you may
expect from the default Emacs completion system.

If you prefer to have the default completion commands a key press away you can
add new bindings or even replace the Vertico bindings. Then the default
completion commands will work as usual. For example you can use =M-TAB= to cycle
between candidates if you have set ~completion-cycle-threshold~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key vertico-map "?" #'minibuffer-completion-help)
  (define-key vertico-map (kbd "M-RET") #'minibuffer-force-complete-and-exit)
  (define-key vertico-map (kbd "M-TAB") #'minibuffer-complete)
#+end_src

The ~orderless~ completion style does not support TAB prefix completion. In
order to enable that you may want to combine ~orderless~ with ~substring~, or
not use ~orderless~ at all.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq completion-styles '(substring orderless))
  (setq completion-styles '(basic substring partial-completion flex))
#+end_src

If Vertico is active, it makes sense to disable the automatic =*Completions*=
buffer by setting ~completion-auto-help~ to ~nil~. TAB-completion can be made
less noisy by setting ~completion-show-inline-help~ to ~nil~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (advice-add #'vertico--setup :after
              (lambda (&rest _)
                (setq-local completion-auto-help nil
                            completion-show-inline-help nil)))
#+end_src

* Complementary packages

Vertico works well together with a few complementary packages, which enrich the
completion UI. These packages are fully supported:

- [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][Marginalia]]: Rich annotations in the minibuffer
- [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]]: Many useful search and navigation commands
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]]: Minibuffer actions and context menu
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]]: Advanced completion style

In case you want to use Vertico for completion-at-point/completion-in-region,
you can use the function ~consult-completion-in-region~ provided by the Consult
package.

You may also want to look into my [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu]] package, which provides a minimal
completion system for completion-in-region using overlays. Corfu is developed in
the same spirit as Vertico.

* Alternatives

There are many alternative completion UIs, each UI with its own advantages and
disadvantages. The [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum readme]] gives an extensive comparison of many
available completion systems from the perspective of Selectrum.

Vertico aims to be fully compliant with all Emacs commands and achieves that
with a minimal code base, relying purely on ~completing-read~ while avoiding to
invent its own APIs. Inventing a custom API as Helm or Ivy is explicitly avoided
in order to increase flexibility and package reuse.

Since Vertico only provides the UI, you may want to combine it with some of the
complementary packages, to give a full-featured completion experience similar to
Ivy. Vertico is targeted at users interested in crafting their Emacs precisely
to their liking - completion plays an integral part in how the users interacts
with Emacs. There are at least two other interactive completion UIs, which
follow a similar philosophy:

- [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]]: If you are looking for a less minimalistic and more full-featured
  (but also more complex) package, you may be interested in Selectrum, which has
  a similar UI as Vertico. Additionally Selectrum supports Avy-style quick keys,
  a horizontal display and a configurable buffer display.
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical][Icomplete-vertical]]: This package enhances the Emacs builtin Icomplete with a
  vertical display. In contrast to Vertico, the candidates are rotated such that
  the current candidate always appears at the top. From my perspective,
  candidate rotation feels a bit less intuitive than the UI of Vertico or
  Selectrum. Note that Emacs 28 offers an built-in ~icomplete-vertical-mode~.

* Problematic completion commands

  Vertico works well and is robust in most scenarios. However a few completion
  commands make certain assumptions about the completion styles and the
  completion UI. Some of these assumptions may not hold in Vertico and as such
  require minor workarounds.

** ~org-set-tags-command~

 ~org-set-tags-command~ implements a completion table which relies on the ~basic~
 completion style and TAB completion. This table does not work well with Vertico
 and Icomplete. The issue can be mitigated by deactivating most of the Vertico UI
 and relying purely on TAB completion. The UI is still enhanced by Vertico, since
 Vertico shows the available tags.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (defun disable-selection ()
     (when (eq minibuffer-completion-table #'org-tags-completion-function)
       (setq-local vertico-map minibuffer-local-completion-map
                   completion-cycle-threshold nil
                   completion-styles '(basic))))
   (advice-add #'vertico--setup :before #'disable-selection)
 #+end_src

 In order to fix the issues properly, ~org-set-tags-command~ should be
 implemented using ~completing-read-multiple~ as discussed on the [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2020-07/msg00222.html][mailing list]].

** ~tmm-menubar~

 The text menu bar works well with Vertico but always shows a =*Completions*=
 buffer, which is unwanted if you are using the Vertico UI. This completion
 buffer can be disabled as follows.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (advice-add #'tmm-add-prompt :after #'minibuffer-hide-completions)
 #+end_src
