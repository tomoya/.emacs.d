(eval-and-compile
  ;; Â¡FIXME!  The GNUmakefile of elpa.git uses:
  ;;
  ;;    ... -L $(dir $@) -f batch-byte-compile $<
  ;;
  ;; to compile each file.  This is handy for some cases such as files in
  ;; `contrib' subdirectories but for this `pcase.el' file it causes this
  ;; `pcase.el' to hide the *real* `pcase.el'.  So we workaround this problem
  ;; here by removing the offending element from `load-path'.  Yuck!
  ;;
  ;; We should probably change GNUmakefile instead so it doesn't forcefully
  ;; add the directory to `load-path', e.g. make this dependent on the
  ;; presence of special file like `.dont-add-to-load-path'. 
  (when load-file-name

;;; Commentary:

;; Apply a simple pattern match defined with pcase on the element of a list.
